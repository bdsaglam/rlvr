      "   - Do not infer information not explicitly stated in the documents. If a document does not mention a required detail (e.g., a president’s name or a river near Hanoi), state this **but** extract all related entities that could aid follow-up steps.  \n",

      "5. **Format Output Clearly**  \n",
      "   - Use the `KeyInformation` class with `info` (specific fact) and `source_doc_id` (document ID).  \n",

      "**Instruction for the Assistant:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given a `question` and `all_information`, your task is to determine whether the provided information contains **sufficient, relevant, and accurate details** to answer the question. Follow these steps to ensure correctness:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Analyze the Question:**\n",
      "   - Identify key entities, dates, and relationships (e.g., \"father of the artist,\" \"Cameroon's main ally in 1306,\" \"largest peacekeeping troop contributor\").\n",
      "   - Note any historical, geopolitical, or contextual nuances (e.g., Cameroon as a modern nation did not exist in 1306; Ethiopia's role as a peacekeeping contributor).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Extract and Validate Information:**\n",
      "   - Use `all_information` to locate **directly relevant facts**. For example:\n",
      "     - If the question asks about a person’s parent, ensure the provided information explicitly states the parent-child relationship (e.g., \"John Lennon's father is Alfred Lennon\").\n",
      "     - For historical events, verify timelines align (e.g., Cameroon’s modern alliances vs. 1306).\n",
      "   - Discard irrelevant or loosely connected details (e.g., Nubian kings unrelated to Cameroon’s 1306 allies).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cite Supporting Documents:**\n",
      "   - **Mandatory:** Include all document IDs (e.g., [14], [19]) that directly support your answer.\n",
      "   - Avoid citing documents unrelated to the question (e.g., [7] in Example 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Determine Sufficiency (`has_collected_enough_info`):**\n",
      "   - **Set to `True`** only if:\n",
      "     - All components of the question are explicitly answered using `all_information`.\n",
      "     - No external data is needed (e.g., the annexation date of Eritrea and Ethiopia’s troop contribution are both provided in Example 3).\n",
      "   - **Set to `False`** if:\n",
      "     - Key information is missing (e.g., Cameroon’s 1306 ally is not specified in Example 2).\n",
      "     - The provided data is contradictory or incomplete.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Improve Retrieval Precision:**\n",
      "   - Use **specific search terms** (e.g., \"largest peacekeeping troop contributor 2016\" instead of vague terms like \"peacekeeping\").\n",
      "   - Avoid broad queries that retrieve irrelevant documents (e.g., \"king\" in Example 2 led to unrelated Nubian ruler [6]).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Example-Driven Reasoning:**\n",
      "   - **For complex questions with nested dependencies** (e.g., \"Eritrea annexed by the largest peacekeeping troop contributor\"), break down the question into subparts:\n",
      "     1. Identify the entity (e.g., Ethiopia as the largest contributor).\n",
      "     2. Verify the historical event (e.g., Eritrea annexed in 1953).\n",
      "   - Ensure all subparts are addressed in `all_information`.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Special Cases:**\n",
      "   - If the question references **modern entities in historical contexts** (e.g., Cameroon in 1306), explicitly note the anachronism in your reasoning.\n",
      "   - For questions involving **numerical data** (e.g., \"8,324 personnel\"), confirm the source provides exact figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Output Requirements:**\n",
      "- Provide a `reasoning` field that logically connects the question to the evidence in `all_information`.\n",
      "- Set `has_collected_enough_info` to `True` or `False` based on the above criteria.\n",
      "- Ensure **zero tolerance for hallucinations**: Only use information explicitly stated in `all_information`.\n",

Follow these guidelines:  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Entity Disambiguation**:  \n",
      "   - Explicitly distinguish between similar-sounding or related entities (e.g., \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\" vs. \"Republic of the Congo\").  \n",
      "   - Verify the exact name of countries, people, or concepts mentioned in the question (e.g., clarify \"Purmerbuurt\" as part of the Netherlands).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Multi-Hop Reasoning**:  \n",
      "   - Identify the next logical step in the reasoning chain. For example:  \n",
      "     - If the question requires a leader of a country, ensure the query specifies the **exact country name** and **timeframe** (e.g., \"First president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo after independence\").  \n",
      "     - If the question involves relationships (e.g., \"successor of Willem-Alexander\"), include **title hierarchies** (e.g., \"King of the Netherlands\") and **dates** to avoid ambiguity.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Precision and Recall Balance**:  \n",
      "   - Use **specific terminology** (e.g., \"main subject of biographies of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\" instead of vague terms like \"biography details\").  \n",
      "   - Avoid redundancy in queries (e.g., do not repeat country independence dates unless necessary).  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Contextual Clues**:  \n",
      "   - Incorporate known facts from collected info into the query (e.g., if the question links to an \"effect,\" explicitly name it, as in \"Mozart effect\").  \n",
      "   - For questions involving locations (e.g., \"Bafwasende\"), confirm the correct geopolitical entity in the query (e.g., \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Iterative Refinement**:  \n",
      "   - If prior attempts retrieved irrelevant documents, narrow the query by adding qualifiers (e.g., \"successor of Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands\" instead of \"successor of Willem-Alexander\").  \n",
      "   - Prioritize exact titles, official names, and dates (e.g., \"Fulbert Youlou\" instead of \"first leader of Congo\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Example**:  \n",
      "For a question like \"Who followed Willem-Alexander of the country, bearing the official name, sometimes known as the country having Purmerbuurt?\"  \n",
      "- Use the collected info to map \"Purmerbuurt\" to the Netherlands.  \n",
      "- Frame the query as \"Successor of Willem-Alexander, King of the Netherlands\" to ensure specificity and avoid confusion with other \"Willem-Alexanders.\"  \n",

      "### Revised Instruction for the Assistant\n",
      "\n",
      "**Task Description:**  \n",
      "You are to extract **precise, actionable, and unambiguous key information** from documents to either directly answer a question or provide **entities/relationships** critical for subsequent retrieval steps. Focus on **entities** (people, places, organizations), **relationships** (explicit or implied connections), **dates** (exact day, month, year), and **facts** (specific claims or events). If documents lack direct answers, extract **intermediate clues** (e.g., partial entities, contextual relationships) that could guide further research. Avoid speculative reasoning but document all relevant leads.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Critical Guidelines:**  \n",
      "1. **Extract All Entities with Context**  \n",
      "   - Extract **all entities** (names, locations, organizations) even if their connection to the question is indirect.  \n",
      "   - Example: If a question involves a \"country with a constitution,\" extract all countries mentioned in documents (e.g., \"India\") and note their constitutional status if explicitly stated.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prioritize Exact Dates and Locations**  \n",
      "   - Capture **full dates** (e.g., \"April 17, 2008\") and **geographic specificity** (e.g., \"New Delhi, India\").  \n",
      "   - If a document mentions an event (e.g., \"2008 Summer Olympics torch relay\"), explicitly note its location and date.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Map Relationships with Explicit Evidence**  \n",
      "   - Identify **direct relationships** (e.g., \"Iron Maiden performed 'Wasted Years'\") and **indirect relationships** (e.g., \"New Delhi hosts the World Bank regional office\").  \n",
      "   - If a relationship is implied but not stated (e.g., \"India has a constitution\"), extract the entity (India) and note the implication as a clue for follow-up.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Avoid Assumptions but Capture Leads**  \n",
      "   - Do not infer information not explicitly stated. If a document does not mention a required detail (e.g., \"Georges Doriot’s school\"), extract **all related entities** (e.g., \"Boston, Massachusetts\") that could guide next steps.  \n",
      "   - Example: If a question asks about a \"capital of a state with a constitutional country,\" extract the capital (e.g., \"Boston\") and the country’s constitutional status if mentioned.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Format Output for Precision and Completeness**  \n",
      "   - Use the `KeyInformation` class with `info` (specific fact) and `source_doc_id`.  \n",
      "   - Include **all relevant facts**, even if they only partially address the question (e.g., \"New Delhi is in India\" if the question involves India’s constitution).  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Applications:**  \n",
      "- **For questions involving nested relationships** (e.g., \"capital of the state containing the school of X\"):  \n",
      "  - Extract the person (X), their education institution (if mentioned), the state, and the capital’s land area.  \n",
      "  - If the school is missing, extract all locations (e.g., \"New Delhi\") and organizations (e.g., \"World Bank\") for follow-up.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **For questions involving implied connections** (e.g., \"city with World Bank regional office in a constitutional country\"):  \n",
      "  - Extract the city (e.g., \"New Delhi\") and country (e.g., \"India\") and note India’s constitutional status if stated.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **For questions requiring entity disambiguation** (e.g., \"band that performed Wasted Years\"):  \n",
      "  - Extract the band name (e.g., \"Iron Maiden\") and link it to the documentary (e.g., \"Classic Albums: Iron Maiden – The Number of the Beast\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Goal:** Ensure the extracted information is **sufficient to answer the question directly** or **provides unambiguous leads** for the next retrieval step. Prioritize **precision over completeness** when documents conflict or lack clarity.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Key Requirements:**  \n",
      "1. **Break down the question into reasoning steps**: Identify the exact entities, relationships, or facts that must be resolved in sequence. For example:  \n",
      "   - If the question involves a chain of events (e.g., \"X did Y to Z\"), ensure each link in the chain is addressed step-by-step.  \n",
      "   - Prioritize resolving ambiguous or missing entities (e.g., \"country X\" → specify the exact name once partially known).  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use precise terms and entities from collected info**:  \n",
      "   - Incorporate **exact names** of countries, historical periods, or specific events (e.g., \"Portuguese colonial period in Brazil\" instead of \"colonial era\").  \n",
      "   - Avoid vague terms like \"blockade\" or \"migration\" without contextualizing them with dates or actors (e.g., \"Turkey's 1993 border closure with Armenia\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Balance recall and precision**:  \n",
      "   - Include **multiple relevant keywords** to capture all potential documents (e.g., \"Slavic population in Brazil during Portuguese colonial rule\" instead of \"Slavs in Brazil\").  \n",
      "   - Exclude irrelevant noise by avoiding overly broad terms (e.g., avoid \"open border\" alone; instead, pair it with specific actors like \"Armenia-Morocco border negotiations\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Leverage historical and geographic context**:  \n",
      "   - For questions involving colonization, migration, or historical control, explicitly reference timeframes (e.g., \"5th-6th century Slavic migration\") or governing powers (e.g., \"Ottoman dynasty-commissioned buildings in Morocco\").  \n",
      "   - Clarify ambiguous regions (e.g., \"South America\" → \"Brazil\" if the colonial holding is known).  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Structure queries for multi-hop dependencies**:  \n",
      "   - If the next step depends on resolving a prior entity (e.g., \"country X\" where X is a placeholder), explicitly include the placeholder in the query (e.g., \"population of Slavs in [Portuguese colony] during [timeframe]\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Effective Queries:**  \n",
      "- Instead of \"When did the UK take control of South Africa?\" → \"When did the United Kingdom establish colonial rule over South Africa?\"  \n",
      "- Instead of \"who wants to open the border between Armenia and Morocco\" → \"Armenia-Morocco border reopening proposals by [specific stakeholders, e.g., Turkish business lobby]\".  \n",
      "- Instead of \"population of Slavs in Brazil\" → \"Slavic population in Portuguese colonial Brazil during the 16th-18th centuries\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Domain-Specific Notes:**  \n",
      "- For questions involving **historical colonization** (e.g., Portugal in Brazil), include the **timeframe** and **governing entity** explicitly.  \n",
      "- For **migration events** (e.g., Slavic migration), specify the **origin/destination regions** and **dates** to avoid ambiguity.  \n",
      "- For **religious or architectural contexts** (e.g., Ottoman-commissioned buildings in Morocco), link the entity to its exact location and historical role (e.g., \"Ottoman dynasty-commissioned mosques at al-Qarawiyin University\").  \n",

      "   - Use the provided `collected_info` to determine what is already known and what remains unresolved. For example:  \n",
      "     - If the performer of a song is known, the next hop is to resolve their record label.  \n",
      "     - If a person’s city of association is known but their birthplace is not, prioritize resolving the birthplace.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Generate Specific Search Queries**:  \n",
      "   - Focus on **precise entities** and **domain-specific terms** to avoid irrelevant results. Examples:  \n",
      "     - Instead of \"mosaic in the church of [City],\" use \"[Specific Church Name] mosaic\" if the church is known.  \n",
      "     - For record labels, include the artist’s name and time frame (e.g., \"Christina Aguilera record label 2000s\").  \n",
      "   - Avoid broad terms like \"near\" or \"close to\" unless paired with exact locations (e.g., \"distance between Wrigley Field and [Specific Water Source]\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Balance Recall and Precision**:  \n",
      "   - Prioritize **high-precision queries** by:  \n",
      "     - Specifying exact names (e.g., \"Clifford Jordan birthplace\" instead of \"jazz musician birthplace\").  \n",
      "     - Including contextual details (e.g., \"Thessaloniki church mosaics\" + known church names like \"Church of Saint Demetrios\").  \n",
      "   - Ensure **high recall** by covering all possible variations of the entity or fact (e.g., multiple names for a location or historical terms).  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Iterative Refinement**:  \n",
      "   - If the initial search yields irrelevant results, refine the query by:  \n",
      "     - Adding constraints (e.g., time period, geographic specificity).  \n",
      "     - Replacing ambiguous terms with verified entities from prior steps.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Domain-Specific Considerations**:  \n",
      "- **Music Industry**: Record labels often change over time; include dates if available.  \n",
      "- **Geography**: For proximity questions, resolve exact coordinates or landmarks (e.g., \"Lake Michigan\" as a water source).  \n",
      "- **Art History**: Mosaics are often tied to specific churches or historical periods; include both in queries.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Workflow**:  \n",
      "For the question *\"What is the record label of the performer of [Song]?\"*:  \n",
      "1. Resolve the performer (already done in `collected_info`).  \n",
      "2. Generate a query like \"[Performer Name] record label [Time Period]\" to narrow results.  \n",
      "3. Verify the label’s relevance to the song’s release date.  \n",

      "\n",
      "You are to answer **multi-hop questions** by synthesizing information from provided documents. Follow these guidelines:  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Answer Structure**:  \n",
      "   - Provide a **concise, direct answer** to the question using **exact entities/dates/facts** from the documents.  \n",
      "   - Include **citations** (document IDs in brackets, e.g., [13]) for **every factual claim** in your answer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Reasoning Process**:  \n",
      "   - Break the question into parts (e.g., identify key entities, relationships, or events).  \n",
      "   - Map each part to the **specific document(s)** that provide the necessary information.  \n",
      "   - Combine information logically to form the answer, ensuring **all supporting documents are cited**.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Citation Rules**:  \n",
      "   - **Cite all documents** that directly support **any step of your reasoning**, even if they do not directly state the final answer.  \n",
      "   - Avoid omitting citations for intermediate facts (e.g., linking \"Bermuda’s non-natives\" [8] and \"Australopithecus fossils in South Africa\" [14] to the final answer about British control in 1909 [4]).  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Precision**:  \n",
      "   - Use **verbatim data** (e.g., \"June 29, 1776\" [13], not \"in the 18th century\").  \n",
      "   - Do not infer or generalize beyond the provided documents.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Examples to Follow**:  \n",
      "   - For questions requiring **multi-hop reasoning** (e.g., connecting Bermuda’s population [8] to South Africa’s history [4]), cite **all relevant documents** in the reasoning and answer.  \n",
      "   - Ensure answers are **token-accurate** (e.g., \"Classic Albums: Iron Maiden – The Number of the Beast\" [13], not \"the Iron Maiden documentary\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Domain-Specific Notes**:  \n",
      "- **Multi-hop questions** often require chaining facts (e.g., \"Country X took control of Country Y\" may involve documents about X’s colonization of Y and Y’s fossil records).  \n",
      "- **Citations are graded strictly**: Missing a supporting document (e.g., [8] in Example 2) reduces citation F1 score, even if the answer is factually correct.  \n",
      "- **Avoid assumptions**: Only use information explicitly stated in the documents (e.g., do not assume Bermuda is part of Britain unless stated in [2]).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Generalizable Strategy**:  \n",
      "- Parse the question into components (e.g., \"Country A\" and \"Country B\").  \n",
      "- Retrieve documents for each component.  \n",
      "- Verify relationships between components using the documents.  \n",
      "- Construct the answer with **exact phrases** and **all relevant citations**.\n",

      "2. **Use specific, unambiguous terms**:  \n",

      "   - If a term is ambiguous (e.g., \"Five Treasure Island\"), explicitly verify its relevance or correct interpretation in the query.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Balance recall and precision**:  \n",
      "   - Aim for queries that retrieve **highly relevant documents** while covering possible variations (e.g., \"John Lennon father\" is sufficient for a well-known figure, but for lesser-known entities, add context like \"full name\" or \"biography\").  \n",

      "### Revised Instruction for the Assistant\n",
      "\n",
      "**Task Description:**  \n",
      "You are to extract **precise and actionable key information** from provided documents that either directly answers a question or provides entities/relationships needed for the next retrieval step. Focus on **entities** (people, places, organizations), **relationships** (connections between entities), **dates** (including exact years and days), and **facts** (specific claims or events). If documents lack direct answers, extract **intermediate clues** that could guide further research. **Pay special attention to historical periods, their origins, and associated geographic locations, as these often form the crux of the question.**\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Critical Guidelines:**  \n",
      "1. **Extract All Relevant Entities, Including Historical Periods and Their Origins**  \n",
      "   - If a document mentions a historical period (e.g., \"Renaissance,\" \"Enlightenment\"), extract it as an entity and **map it to its commonly known geographic origin** (e.g., \"Renaissance → Italy\") even if the document does not explicitly state this. This is critical for questions about the origin of methods or events tied to such periods.  \n",
      "   - Example: If a document mentions \"the Renaissance,\" extract it as an entity and note its association with Italy, as this is essential for answering questions about where a method originated.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prioritize Precision in Dates and Event Mapping**  \n",
      "   - Capture **full dates** (day, month, year) if present. If a document references a well-known event (e.g., \"Hurricane Sandy,\" \"Jacobinism\"), explicitly note its **date and geographic impact** (e.g., \"Jacobinism affected all of Europe\").  \n",
      "   - If a document references a monarch or political figure (e.g., \"Philip IV of France\"), extract their **reign dates, titles, and territories** even if the connection to the question is indirect.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Map Relationships Between Entities and Historical Contexts**  \n",
      "   - Identify **indirect connections** (e.g., \"Renaissance → Italy,\" \"Jacobinism → Europe\") that link entities to geographic locations or time periods.  \n",
      "   - Example: If a document links a teaching method to the \"Renaissance,\" extract this relationship and associate it with Italy, as this is key to answering questions about where the method originated.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Avoid Assumptions but Use Common Historical Knowledge for Periods**  \n",
      "   - Do not infer information not explicitly stated in the documents **except for well-documented historical periods and events** (e.g., Renaissance in Italy, Jacobinism in Europe). For such cases, extract the **period** and **its geographic origin** as a relationship.  \n",
      "   - Example: If a document mentions \"the Enlightenment,\" extract it as an entity and note its association with northern Europe, as this is a well-established historical fact.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Format Output Clearly for Direct or Intermediate Use**  \n",
      "   - Use the `KeyInformation` class with `info` (specific fact) and `source_doc_id` (document ID).  \n",
      "   - Include **all relevant facts** from documents, even if they only partially address the question. For example, if a document mentions a king’s reign but not their ally, extract the king’s name and reign dates as potential clues for follow-up research.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Application for Historical Periods:**  \n",
      "If a question asks about the origin of a method during a specific period (e.g., \"Where did associationism originate?\"), and a document mentions it began in the \"Renaissance,\" extract:  \n",
      "- `KeyInformation(info='Associationism originated during the Renaissance.', source_doc_id='6')`  \n",
      "- `KeyInformation(info='The Renaissance is historically associated with Italy.', source_doc_id='6')`  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Application for Political Figures and Allies:**  \n",
      "If a question asks about a country’s ally in a specific year (e.g., \"Who was the king of Cameroon’s main ally in 1306?\") and a document mentions \"Philip IV of France,\" extract:  \n",
      "- `KeyInformation(info='Philip IV of France reigned from 1285–1314.', source_doc_id='14')`  \n",
      "- `KeyInformation(info='France is a potential candidate for Cameroon’s main ally in 1306.', source_doc_id='14')`  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Goal:** Ensure the extracted information is **sufficient for the next retrieval step** or **directly answers the question** with unambiguous precision, leveraging both explicit document content and **commonly accepted historical associations** for well-known periods and events.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Exact Entity Matching**:\n",
      "   - Identify the specific entity in the question (e.g., \"Democratic Republic of Congo\" vs. \"Republic of the Congo\"). Use the exact name or abbreviation provided in the question.\n",
      "   - If the question references a location (e.g., \"county,\" \"city,\" \"country\"), ensure the answer matches the geographic scope (e.g., \"Washington, D.C.\" is a federal district, not a county; \"Washington County, Kansas\" is a distinct entity).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Political/Historical Precision**:\n",
      "   - For questions about leadership or historical events, verify the timeline and jurisdiction (e.g., independence dates, roles like \"first president\" or \"first leader\"). Avoid conflating similar-sounding entities (e.g., DRC and Republic of Congo).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Document Relevance**:\n",
      "   - Retrieve only documents that directly address the question's core elements. Avoid over-broad searches (e.g., \"Father's Day\" might retrieve irrelevant documents about unrelated topics like space centers).\n",
      "   - If multiple documents exist, prioritize those with the most specific and unambiguous information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Citations**:\n",
      "   - Cite only the documents that directly support the answer. Exclude irrelevant or redundant documents (e.g., duplicate statements about the same fact).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Final Determination**:\n",
      "   - Set `has_collected_enough_info` to **True** only if the `all_information` explicitly contains the answer (e.g., \"Red River\" is in Hanoi, and the question asks about the river near Mai Van Hoa's birthplace).\n",
      "   - Set it to **False** if the information is incomplete, ambiguous, or addresses a different entity (e.g., Fulbert Youlou is linked to the Republic of Congo, but the question asks about the DRC).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
      "- If the question asks for the first leader of the **DRC**, but the information only discusses the **Republic of Congo**, the answer is **False**.\n",
      "- If the question asks for a **county** containing a president's work location, and the information mentions **Washington, D.C.** (a federal district), the answer is **False** unless a specific county is named.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Avoid Common Pitfalls**:\n",
      "- Confusing similar names (e.g., \"Washington County, Kansas\" vs. \"Washington, D.C.\").\n",
      "- Including irrelevant documents (e.g., mentioning Kennedy Space Center for a question about Father's Day).\n",
      "- Overlooking jurisdictional distinctions (e.g., federal vs. county-level entities).\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Parse the Question**:  \n",
      "   - Break the question into **specific entities, relationships, or data points** (e.g., \"city where X was born\" → identify \"city,\" \"X,\" and the relationship \"birthplace\").  \n",

      "   - **Check for explicit matches**: Only use information **directly stated** in `all_information` (e.g., if the question asks about \"Italy\" but `all_information` only mentions \"Europe,\" do not infer \"Italy\").  \n",
      "   - **Resolve conflicts**: Prioritize the **most specific or unambiguous source** (e.g., if a location is mentioned in two documents, prefer the one with higher specificity).  \n",

      "3. **Generate Reasoning**:  \n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Citation Precision**:  \n",

      "\n",
      "6. **Key Considerations**:  \n",
      "   - **Specificity over generality**: If `all_information` states \"Europe\" but the question asks for a country (e.g., \"Italy\"), the answer must be \"Europe\" unless \"Italy\" is explicitly mentioned.  \n",
      "   - **Avoid overgeneralization**: Do not assume a broader context (e.g., if `all_information` mentions \"al-Qarawiyin University in Morocco,\" do not assume Morocco’s border policies with Armenia unless explicitly stated).  \n",
      "   - **Redundant data**: Ignore duplicate entries (e.g., repeated mentions of Turkey’s border closure in Example 2).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Critical Errors to Avoid**:  \n",
      "- **Example 3**: The assistant answered \"Europe\" based on `all_information` stating the Renaissance began in Europe. However, if the expected answer is \"Italy,\" this indicates the question requires **more specific information** (e.g., \"Italy\") that is **not present** in `all_information`. The assistant must not infer beyond the provided data.  \n",
      "- **Example 2**: The assistant missed citing [6] (which links al-Qarawiyin University to Morocco) and failed to retrieve [16], reducing citation accuracy. Always verify all documents that directly support the reasoning.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Output Format**:  \n",
      "- `reasoning`: A step-by-step explanation of how each question component is addressed by `all_information`, with **explicit citations** for every claim.  \n",
      "- `has_collected_enough_info`: A boolean (`True`/`False`) based on whether **all required information is explicitly present** and **correctly cited**.\n",

Your output must include two components:  \n",

      "1. **Reasoning**:  \n",
      "   - Identify the key entities, relationships, and temporal/geographic links in the question (e.g., \"city where RSA Conference was held\" → \"San Francisco\").  \n",

      "   - Check if **supporting documents** (e.g., [11], [13]) directly address the question’s components. Avoid citing irrelevant documents.  \n",

      "- **Entity Resolution**: Ensure entities in the question (e.g., \"Al-Qanjarah\" → \"Syria\") are explicitly resolved in `all_information`.  \n",
      "- **Temporal/Geographic Precision**: Verify that dates and locations in the answer are directly tied to the question’s context (e.g., \"634 CE\" in Example 3).  \n",
      "- **Document Relevance**: Prioritize documents that directly answer the question (e.g., [3] for invasion date in Example 3). Avoid including irrelevant documents (e.g., [15] in Example 3 feedback).  \n",
      "- **Citation Fidelity**: Only cite documents that **directly support** the answer (e.g., [11] and [13] in Example 1). Omit documents that are tangential or unrelated.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Workflow**:  \n",
      "1. Parse the question into sub-questions (e.g., \"When was [X] founded?\" where X is the conference city).  \n",
      "2. Match each sub-question to `all_information` entries.  \n",
      "3. Confirm that all required information is explicitly stated and supported by the correct documents.  \n",
      "4. Validate that no irrelevant documents are cited.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Critical Edge Cases**:  \n",
      "- If the question requires **chaining multiple facts** (e.g., \"country where X happened\" → \"Y country\" → \"Z event in Y\"), ensure all links are present in `all_information`.  \n",
      "- If the answer requires **inference** (e.g., deducing a date from context), mark `False` unless the inference is explicitly stated.  \n",
