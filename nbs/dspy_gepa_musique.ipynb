Your task is to meticulously analyze a given question and a set of retrieved documents to extract key pieces of information. These extracted facts are crucial, as they will either directly answer a part of the question or serve as the foundation for a subsequent retrieval or reasoning step.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Core Principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** Before reading the documents, break down the user's question into its fundamental components. Identify all the entities (people, places, organizations), the relationships between them, and the specific data points being requested (e.g., a date, a location, a name, a numerical value).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Extract Atomic and Precise Facts:** Your primary goal is to extract information as specific, concise data points, not as full sentences.\n",
      "    *   **Good Example:** If the question asks for a temperature in Celsius and the text says \"the average high is around 90 °F (32 °C)\", you should extract `32 °C`.\n",
      "    *   **Bad Example:** Do not extract the entire sentence `\"Summers in the state are generally hot and humid, with most of the state averaging a high of around 90 °F (32 °C) during the summer months.\"`\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Extract All Relevant Partial Information:** This is the most critical rule. Even if the provided documents do not contain enough information to answer the *entire* question, you **must** extract any facts that address *any part* of the deconstructed question. Do not return an empty result just because one piece of the puzzle is missing. Your output enables the next step.\n",
      "    *   **Scenario:** The question is \"What is the county of the birth city of person X?\". The document states \"Person X was born in City Y.\" but does not mention the county.\n",
      "    *   **Your Action:** You must extract `Person X was born in City Y`. This information is the vital next step.\n",
      "    *   **Scenario:** The question requires linking Entity A -> Entity B -> Entity C. The documents only mention the relationship between Entity B and Entity C.\n",
      "    *   **Your Action:** You must extract the `B -> C` relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Strictly Maintain Relevance:** Only extract information that is directly relevant to the entities and relationships mentioned or implied in the question. If a document discusses an entity that cannot be linked to the question's context, you should ignore it completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Output Format:\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide your output as a list of `KeyInformation` objects. Each object must contain:\n",
      "*   `info`: The specific, atomic piece of information you extracted.\n",
      "*   `source_doc_id`: The string ID of the document from which the information was extracted.\n",

Your task is to generate the single *next* search query required to continue the process of answering a complex question, based on the information gathered so far.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Follow these steps to generate your response:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Decompose the Question:** First, analyze the full multi-hop question. Identify the chain of entities and the relationships between them. Mentally break down the question into a sequence of smaller, dependent sub-questions. For example, for the question \"What is the population of the city where the director of film X was born?\", the sub-questions are:\n",

      "    *   Use this information to determine the immediate next sub-question that needs to be answered.\n",
      "    *   Clearly state what piece of information you are targeting with your next query and how it fits into the overall plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Craft a Precise and Efficient Search Query:** This is the most critical step. Your `search_query` must be meticulously designed to retrieve the specific fact you need.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Principle 1: Be Laser-Focused and Specific.** Your query must be unambiguous. Use unique, identifying context from the question to avoid generic results.\n",
      "        *   *Bad Query:* `capital city embassy`\n",
      "        *   *Good Query:* `capital that encouraged purges against Titoites` (This is a much more specific and unique identifier).\n",

      "        *   *Good Query:* `John Haviland death location`\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Principle 2: Bridge Multiple Hops for Efficiency.** To minimize the total number of search turns, you should try to resolve multiple, consecutive sub-questions in a single query whenever it is logical and natural to do so.\n",
      "        *   **Example:** For the question about the director of \"Su intimo secreto\" and their country of citizenship, instead of two separate queries (one for the director, one for their citizenship), combine them.\n",
      "            *   *Good Combined Query:* `director of Su intimo secreto and country of citizenship`\n",
      "        *   **Example:** For the question about the science museum in Seville and what it's part of, combine the search for the museum with the search for its parent organization.\n",
      "            *   *Good Combined Query:* `science museum in Seville and its affiliation`\n",
      "        *   This strategy of \"query packing\" is key to reducing the number of steps. Look ahead in your reasoning plan and see if the next two logical steps can be merged.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Specify the Number of Results (`top_n`):** For a well-formed, highly specific query designed to find a single fact, `top_n: 1` is almost always sufficient. This reinforces the goal of precision.\n",

Your task is to meticulously analyze a given question and a set of retrieved documents, and then extract all key pieces of information from the documents that are relevant to answering the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Principles:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Strictly Grounded in Documents:** Every piece of information you extract **must** come directly and explicitly from the provided documents. Do not use any external knowledge, make assumptions, or infer information that is not stated in the text. For example, if a document mentions \"Riverbank State Park is 21m over the Hudson River\", you can extract that. You cannot add external facts like \"The Hudson is the largest river in New York\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Extract All Relevant Clues, Not Just the Final Answer:** The documents may not contain the complete answer. Your goal is to find all the relevant puzzle pieces that help constrain the problem or lead to the next step.\n",
      "    *   If a document answers a sub-part of the question, extract that information.\n",
      "    *   If a document mentions an entity (a person, place, organization, date, etc.) from the question, you **must** extract the surrounding facts about that entity, even if it doesn't seem to answer the whole question directly. For example, if the question is about \"Crazy Horse's birthplace\" and a document says \"the Crazy Horse Memorial is in South Dakota\", you must extract this fact. It connects the entity \"Crazy Horse\" to a location, \"South Dakota\", which is a critical clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Focus on Atomic Facts:** Extract information as concise, self-contained facts, focusing on entities, their relationships, and key attributes like dates, locations, and quantities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Handle Seemingly Irrelevant Documents:** If a document was retrieved, it likely contains a keyword or entity from the question. Your job is to find that connection, no matter how small, and extract the relevant sentence or fact. If a document has absolutely zero connection to any part of the question, you can ignore it and extract nothing from it.\n",

Your task is to determine if the information collected so far is sufficient to fully and accurately answer a given question.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Your Goal:**\n",
      "Given a `question` and a body of text called `all_information`, you must produce a boolean field `has_collected_enough_info`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** First, carefully analyze the `question` and break it down into all its essential components and sub-questions. Identify every piece of information that is required to construct a complete answer. This includes entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Verify Information Availability:** For each component identified in step 1, you must verify if a corresponding piece of information exists within the provided `all_information`. Your evaluation must be based *strictly* on the text in `all_information`. Do not use any external knowledge you might have.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Check for Connectivity:** It is not enough that individual facts are present. You must ensure that you can link all the necessary pieces of information together to bridge the gap from the start of the question to the end. If a crucial link or relationship between two pieces of information is missing, then the information is insufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Make Your Decision:**\n",
      "    *   Set `has_collected_enough_info` to `True` **only if** every single component and link required to answer the question is explicitly present in `all_information`.\n",
      "    *   Set `has_collected_enough_info` to `False` if even one piece of required information is missing, if a link between facts cannot be established, or if there is any ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Principles to Follow:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Be a Strict Verifier:** Your role is not to infer or guess. If the text doesn't explicitly state a fact needed to answer the question, you must assume the information is missing.\n",
      "*   **Focus on Sufficiency, Not the Final Answer:** Your task is to decide *if* the question *can be* answered, not to actually formulate the answer itself.\n",
      "*   **Example Scenario:** If the question is \"What is the population of the capital city of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located?\", you must verify that `all_information` contains:\n",
      "    1.  The country where the Eiffel Tower is located (France).\n",
      "    2.  The capital of that specific country (Paris).\n",
      "    3.  The population of that specific capital city.\n",
      "    If any of these three pieces of information is missing, `has_collected_enough_info` must be `False`.\n",

Given a `question` and the `all_information` collected so far, you must determine if the information is sufficient to formulate a complete and final answer. You will produce a boolean field `has_collected_enough_info`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** First, break down the `question` into the essential pieces of information required to answer it. Identify all the entities and the relationships between them that need to be resolved.\n",
      "    *   For example, for the question \"What is the equivalent of organization X in the country that helped establish entity Y?\", you need to know:\n",
      "        1.  The country that helped establish entity Y.\n",
      "        2.  The equivalent of organization X in that specific country.\n",

      "2.  **Evaluate the Collected Information:** Carefully examine the text in `all_information` to see if it contains the answer to *every single one* of the pieces of information you identified in the previous step.\n",

      "        *   The `all_information` is missing *any* of the essential pieces of information needed to answer the question. If you have found the country but not the equivalent organization in that country, you do not have enough information. The chain of facts must be complete.\n",

      "### Citation Rules\n",

This includes documents used for intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., identifying a person, a place, or a connection between two entities).\n",
      "    *   **Example:** To answer \"When did the performer of 'Love Profusion' end their relationship with Carlos Leon?\", you need one document to identify the performer as Madonna [13] and another to find the date her relationship ended [4]. Therefore, you must cite both `['4', '13']`.\n",

Your task is to analyze a complex question and the information gathered so far, then generate the single best search query to find the next piece of information required to answer the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** First, carefully analyze the user's `question`. Break it down into a logical sequence of smaller, answerable sub-questions. This is your reasoning chain. Your `reasoning` output should clearly articulate this plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Identify the Next Necessary Information:** Based on your reasoning chain and the `collected_info`, determine the immediate next piece of information you need.\n",
      "    *   If `collected_info` is empty, your query should target the first sub-question in your chain.\n",
      "    *   If `collected_info` contains information, use it to formulate a query for the next unresolved sub-question.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Formulate the Search Query:** Create a concise and effective `search_query` to find this next piece of information. Follow these strategic principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Focus on the Immediate Next Step:** Your query must only seek the information for the very next unresolved step. Do not use your internal knowledge to skip ahead in the reasoning chain. For example, if the question requires finding a movie's filming country and then the laws of that country, your first query must be about the filming country, not the laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Combine Independent Sub-questions:** If the main question involves two or more independent lines of inquiry, it is highly effective to combine the search for the first piece of information from each line into a single query.\n",
      "        *   *Example*: For the question \"In what country are the National Register of Historic Places listings in the county with the headquarters of Cameron Health, and the state where Some Like It Hot was filmed?\", a great initial query is \"Cameron Health headquarters location and state where Some Like It Hot was filmed\". This resolves two separate starting points at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Balance Breadth and Specificity for Initial Queries:** When no information has been collected, your first query is crucial.\n",
      "        *   Avoid being overly specific if it might limit results. For a question like \"The country where Flora Steiger-Crawford was born has how many states?\", a query for \"Flora Steiger-Crawford birth country\" might be too narrow. A slightly broader query like \"Flora Steiger-Crawford biography\" or simply \"Flora Steiger-Crawford\" could yield the birth country along with other useful context, leading to a more efficient path overall.\n",
      "        *   Your goal is to create queries that are both **comprehensive** (high recall of relevant facts) and **precise** (low retrieval of irrelevant documents).\n",
      "\n",
      "Your ultimate goal is to devise a query strategy that answers the question in the fewest steps possible by retrieving all necessary supporting information efficiently.\n",

      "\n",
      "Given a complex, multi-hop question and a list of information snippets already collected, your goal is to generate the next search query to find the subsequent piece of information required to answer the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow these steps carefully:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deconstruct the Main Question:** First, analyze the user's `question`. Break it down into a chain of smaller, dependent sub-questions. Identify the entities, relationships, and facts that need to be found in sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Assess Collected Information:** Review the `collected_info`. This represents your current knowledge base. Identify which parts of the question you can already answer and, most importantly, what the very next logical piece of missing information is.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Formulate Your Reasoning:**\n",
      "    *   Clearly state your understanding of the overall question.\n",
      "    *   Summarize what is known from the `collected_info`.\n",
      "    *   Explicitly state the *single next piece of information* you need to find. This should be the target of your search query.\n",
      "    *   Your reasoning must directly lead to and justify the search query you generate.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Generate a High-Quality Search Query:** This is the most critical step. Your `search_query` must be both precise (to avoid irrelevant results) and comprehensive (to find the necessary documents).\n",
      "    *   **Be Specific and Entity-Driven:** Your query should focus on concrete entities (people, places, dates, titles of works, etc.). If you have identified a specific name from the `collected_info` (e.g., \"Pope Paul IV\"), use that specific name in your query instead of a vague description (e.g., \"author of Cum nimis absurdum\").\n",
      "    *   **Combine Key Concepts:** To improve focus, include multiple key entities from the sub-question in your query. For example, instead of just \"hostess of the party\", a better query might be \"Chopin George Sand party hostess\". This provides more context to the search engine.\n",
      "    *   **Use Keywords, Not Full Sentences:** Formulate your query using essential keywords and phrases, much like an expert user of a search engine. Avoid long, conversational questions. For instance, prefer `country with most Australopithecus fossils` over `in which country have the most fossils of Australopithecus been found`.\n",
      "    *   **Target the Immediate Unknown:** The query must be tightly focused on finding only the next piece of information identified in your reasoning. Do not create a query that attempts to answer the entire multi-hop question at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output Format:**\n",
      "You must provide your response in the following structure:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Your task is to generate the next search query to find a missing piece of information needed to answer a given question, based on the information collected so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow these steps:\n",
      "1.  **Decompose the Question:** First, carefully analyze the multi-hop question to understand the chain of entities and relationships. Break down the full question into a logical sequence of smaller, answerable sub-questions. This forms your high-level plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Formulate a Reasoning Plan:** In the `reasoning` field, articulate your immediate step.\n",
      "    *   First, summarize what you know from the `collected_info`.\n",
      "    *   Then, state the single next piece of information you need to find to progress.\n",
      "    *   Explain how this next piece of information fits into your overall decomposition plan to answer the main question.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Craft a Precise and Unambiguous Search Query:** This is the most critical step. Your `search_query` must be designed to retrieve the specific fact you need with high precision.\n",
      "    *   **Use Descriptive Identifiers from the Question:** If the question describes an entity with a unique role or action (e.g., \"the man who became leader of the largest country in Europe...\"), use that description in your query. Do not immediately substitute it with a name from `collected_info` if that information might be incomplete or incorrect. This makes your query more robust. For example, instead of a premature query like `Mikhail Gorbachev death place`, a better query would be `death place of first leader of Russia after Soviet Union collapse`.\n",
      "    *   **Be Specific and Include Disambiguating Context:** Incorporate unique, identifying details from the question to narrow down the search. For a question about a capital city \"...that encouraged purges against Titoites\", your query should contain \"capital that encouraged purges against Titoites\", not just \"capital city\".\n",
      "    *   **Focus on One Fact at a Time:** Each query should aim to resolve only one sub-question from your plan. For instance, if you need to know a person's birth place and then the country that colonized it, your first query should *only* be about the birth place (e.g., `Manuel John Johnson place of birth`).\n",
      "    *   **Mirror the Question's Intent:** Use keywords from the original question that specify recency or state, such as \"new\", \"current\", or \"former\". For a question about the \"new prime minister\", a query like `new prime minister of Romania` is more precise than a generic one.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Specify the Number of Results:** For the `top_n` field, specify the number of search results you want to retrieve. For a well-formed, specific, fact-based query, `1` is almost always sufficient and preferred to maintain high precision.\n",

Given a complex question and a set of retrieved documents, your goal is to extract key pieces of information (facts, entities, relationships, dates) that are relevant to answering the question. Think of this as gathering clues for a multi-step reasoning process. Your output must be a list of these key informational snippets.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Core Principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** Do not try to answer the question directly or in one go. First, break the complex question down into its smaller, constituent parts or sub-questions. Identify the key entities and the specific information needed about them.\n",
      "    *   *Example Question:* \"What incorrect term for the indigenous population originated with the first explorer to discover new land west of Africa and the continent Schreckhorn is on?\"\n",
      "    *   *Deconstruction:*\n",
      "        *   Component 1: The continent where the Schreckhorn is located.\n",
      "        *   Component 2: The identity of the first explorer.\n",
      "        *   Component 3: The incorrect term associated with that explorer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Extract Partial and Relevant Information:** Scan the provided documents for any information that helps answer **any** of the deconstructed components. Even if a document only helps with one small part of the question, that information is a critical clue and must be extracted.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* For the question above, if a document states \"The Schreckhorn... is the northernmost summit rising above 4,000 metres in Europe,\" you must extract the fact that **\"The Schreckhorn is in Europe.\"** This directly addresses the first component of the question and is a vital piece of information for the next step.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Focus on Extraction, Not Answering:** Your primary role is to extract facts, not to synthesize a final answer.\n",
      "    *   Your output should be a list of extracted facts.\n",
      "    *   Do not state that the question is unanswerable based on the provided text. Your job is to find any and all relevant clues.\n",
      "    *   If a document contains absolutely no information relevant to any part of the question, and only then, you may return an empty list.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What to Extract:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Entities and their Attributes:** Extract specific properties of the entities mentioned in the question.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* If the question is about \"Magdolna Purgly\" and the document says she was born in the \"Kingdom of Hungary\", extract **\"Magdolna Purgly was from Hungary\"**.\n",
      "*   **Relationships between Entities:** Extract facts that connect different entities.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* If the question is about America's oil sources and the document mentions \"the United States was the world's third-largest producer of crude oil, after Saudi Arabia and Russia,\" this relationship is potentially relevant and should be extracted.\n",
      "*   **Key Facts, Dates, and Numbers:** Any specific data point that relates to a component of the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these instructions, you will provide the necessary building blocks for a larger system to solve complex questions. Your precision in extracting these intermediate facts is paramount.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Core Task\n",
      "Given a multi-hop question and a collection of information snippets (documents with IDs), your goal is to synthesize the information to formulate a direct answer and provide comprehensive citations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step-by-Step Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** Carefully analyze the user's question. Break it down into smaller, logical sub-questions or entities that need to be linked. Identify the chain of reasoning required to connect all parts of the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Thoroughly Scan All Information:** Read every document provided in the `all_information` section. As you read, identify any facts, names, dates, or relationships that are relevant to the sub-questions you identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Synthesize and Bridge the Hops:** Connect the pieces of information you found across different documents. For example, one document might establish that City A is in Country B, while another document provides a fact about Country B. You must link these two pieces of information to answer a question about City A.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Formulate the Answer:**\n",
      "    *   The answer must be concise and directly address what the question asks.\n",
      "    *   **Crucially, you must use the exact entities, dates, and specific facts as they appear in the source documents.** Do not paraphrase, generalize, or use your own words. For example, if a source document specifies the answer is \"by the end of 1346\", do not simplify it to \"1347\". If a source calls a region the \"Interior Highlands\", use that exact term.\n",
      "    *   Synthesize information from all relevant documents to provide the most precise and complete answer possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Compile All Citations:**\n",
      "    *   Identify every single document that contributed a piece of information to your final answer. This includes documents that support intermediate steps in your reasoning chain.\n",
      "    *   List the IDs of all supporting documents. It is critical to be exhaustive; missing a relevant citation is a failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Critical Rules to Follow\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Use Only Provided Information:** Your answer must be based exclusively on the text in `all_information`. Do not use any external knowledge.\n",
      "*   **Precision is Paramount:** Always choose the most specific and precise information available in the documents. Vague or generalized answers are incorrect if more specific details are present.\n",
      "*   **Cite Everything:** You must cite every document that contains a fact used to construct your answer. If you connect a fact from document [A] to a fact from document [B] to form the answer, you must cite both [A] and [B].\n",
      "*   **Do Not Give Up Easily:** Before concluding that an answer cannot be found, ensure you have meticulously checked every document for relevant information. Only state that the question is unanswerable as a last resort.\n",

      "    *   If the documents do not contain the exact entity mentioned in the question but provide information on a very closely related one (e.g., the question asks about the village of Janabiyah, but the documents only mention the country of Bahrain), extract the information about the related entity (e.g., \"Britain withdrew from Bahrain in 1971\"). This is a valuable clue for the next reasoning step.\n",
      "    *   If the documents can only answer one part of a complex question (e.g., they identify the organization involved but not a number associated with it), extract only the information that is present. Do not invent or infer information that is not in the text.\n",

Given a user's question and a set of retrieved text documents, you must carefully analyze the documents and extract only the key pieces of information that directly help in answering the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Core Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** First, break down the user's question into its core components. Identify the specific entities (people, places, organizations), relationships, and the type of information being asked for (e.g., a date, a reason, a method). Be wary of convoluted phrasing or potential red herrings that are not addressed in the provided documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Targeted and Atomic Extraction:** Scan the documents for information that directly addresses the components of the question. Your goal is not to summarize the documents, but to pull out specific, relevant facts.\n",
      "    *   **Atomicity:** Extract information as small, self-contained, and factual statements. Instead of copying a whole sentence, extract the precise clause or fact that is needed. For example, from \"Alta is an unincorporated community in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, United States,\" you might extract \"Alta is in West Virginia\" and \"West Virginia is in the United States.\"\n",
      "    *   **Causality:** If the question asks \"how\" or \"why,\" ensure your extracted information includes the causal link, method, or event. For example, if a document says \"Taiwan was ceded to Japan following the First Sino-Japanese War,\" the key information is not just \"Taiwan was ceded to Japan,\" but the fact that this happened as a result of the \"First Sino-Japanese War.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Verify Context and Consistency:** When synthesizing information, especially from different documents or different parts of a document, pay close attention to the context.\n",
      "    *   **Temporal Awareness:** Do not link entities or events from different time periods unless the text explicitly supports it. For instance, if one document mentions a player from the 1960s and another mentions the same team's championship in 2017, do not assume the player was part of that championship team. Extract both facts separately and note the temporal gap in your reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Structure Your Output:** You must provide two outputs: `reasoning` and `key_informations`.\n",
      "    *   **`reasoning`:** Provide a clear, step-by-step explanation of your thought process. Describe how you interpreted the question, what information you searched for, and how the extracted `key_informations` connect to form an answer. If the documents are insufficient or contain conflicting/disconnected information (like a temporal mismatch), explicitly state this in your reasoning.\n",
      "    *   **`key_informations`:** Provide a list of the extracted atomic facts. Each fact must be a concise string and must be attributed to its `source_doc_id`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Key Principles:\n",
      "*   **Precision over Completeness:** Extract only what is necessary to answer the specific question asked.\n",
      "*   **Factuality:** Stick to what is explicitly stated in the documents. Do not make assumptions or infer connections that are not supported by the text.\n",
      "*   **Context is King:** Always consider the temporal and situational context of the information before linking facts together.\n"
