# Hypothesis H03: KL Divergence Formula Bug

## Priority: MEDIUM

## Description

~~The KL divergence computation in the GRPO trainer may have the wrong direction. The current formula uses `exp(ref_per_token_logps - per_token_logps)`, but for KL(policy || reference), it should be `exp(per_token_logps - ref_per_token_logps)`. This backwards KL penalty could encourage divergence instead of constraining it.~~

**UPDATE (2025-09-13): Mathematical verification proves the formula is CORRECT.** The k3 estimator formula `exp(ref_logp - policy_logp) - (ref_logp - policy_logp) - 1` correctly estimates KL(policy || reference) when sampling from the policy distribution. See verification scripts for proof.

## Root Cause

**Code Location**: `verifiers/trainers/grpo_trainer.py:1231-1235`

```python
per_token_kl = (
    torch.exp(ref_per_token_logps - per_token_logps)  # ⚠️ Potentially backwards
    - (ref_per_token_logps - per_token_logps)
    - 1
)
```

**Mathematical Issue**: 
- Standard KL(P || Q) = Σ P(x) log(P(x)/Q(x))
- For policy P and reference Q: KL penalty should discourage P from diverging from Q
- Current formula may penalize convergence and reward divergence

## Why It Explains Our Behavior

1. **Policy Instability**: Backwards KL penalty pushes model away from good reference behavior
2. **Oscillation**: Model gets conflicting signals from reward and KL terms
3. **Beta Sensitivity**: Higher KL beta values make problem worse (observed in experiments)

## Validation Methods

### Method 1: Test with KL Beta = 0
**Experiment**:
```bash
python scripts/train_musique.py train \
    --datasets "bdsaglam/musique-mini,answerable,train[:100]" \
    --kl-beta 0.0 \
    --batch-size 8 --num-generations 8 \
    --max-steps 100
```

**Success Criteria**:
- If training improves with beta=0 but fails with beta>0, confirms KL issue
- Should see more stable reward progression

### Method 2: Fix KL Formula and Test
**Code Fix**:
```python
# In verifiers/trainers/grpo_trainer.py, change to:
per_token_kl = (
    torch.exp(per_token_logps - ref_per_token_logps)  # Fixed direction
    - (per_token_logps - ref_per_token_logps)
    - 1
)
```

**Test**: Run with small positive beta (0.01) and compare to current implementation

### Method 3: Log KL Components
**Code Addition**:
```python
if self.beta != 0.0:
    # ... compute KL ...
    if wandb.run:
        wandb.log({
            "debug/kl_mean": mean_kl.item(),
            "debug/kl_max": per_token_kl.max().item(),
            "debug/kl_min": per_token_kl.min().item(),
            "debug/ref_logp_mean": ref_per_token_logps.mean().item(),
            "debug/policy_logp_mean": per_token_logps.mean().item(),
        })
```

**Success Criteria**: 
- KL should be positive and reasonable in magnitude
- KL should increase when policy diverges from reference

### Method 4: Compare Against Standard Implementation
**Reference Check**: Compare with TRL or other RL libraries to verify formula

## Invalidation Criteria

This hypothesis is **invalidated** if:
1. Training with `--kl-beta 0.0` has the same issues
2. KL values logged are reasonable and positive
3. Formula matches standard implementations
4. Fixing the formula doesn't improve training

## Interaction with Other Hypotheses

- **H01 (Advantage Scaling)**: KL bug could amplify advantage scaling problems
- **If H01 is fixed**: KL bug becomes more important to test
- **If H01 not fixed**: May be hard to isolate KL effects

## Current Status: ❌ INVALIDATED (Formula is correct)

## Mathematical Verification (2025-09-13)

### Key Finding: The KL Formula is Mathematically Correct

**Verification Method**: Created mathematical tests (`scripts/verify_kl_direction.py` and `scripts/verify_kl_importance_sampling.py`) to verify the formula.

**Results**:
1. The k3 estimator formula `exp(ref_logp - policy_logp) - (ref_logp - policy_logp) - 1` correctly estimates KL(policy || reference)
2. Both TRL and verifiers libraries use the same correct formula
3. The confusion arose from misunderstanding the importance sampling context

**Mathematical Explanation**:
- When sampling from policy π, we want to estimate KL(π || π_ref)
- The k3 estimator for KL(p || q) when sampling from p uses: exp(log(q/p)) - log(q/p) - 1
- Therefore: log(q/p) = log(π_ref/π) = ref_logp - policy_logp
- The formula is correct as implemented

### Conclusion
The suspected "backwards" KL formula is actually correct. The issues with training must stem from other causes.

### Why We Initially Thought It Was Wrong
The confusion arose from several sources:

1. **Importance Sampling Context Ignored**: The original analysis treated this as direct KL computation rather than Monte Carlo estimation via k3 estimator

2. **Intuitive Direction Confusion**: Seeing `ref_logp - policy_logp` suggested it should be reversed, without understanding the k3 estimator formula

3. **Symptom Correlation**: Setting `kl_beta=0` fixed gradient issues, which seemed to validate the hypothesis, but the real reason was that dr_grpo shouldn't use KL penalty with rule-based verifiers

4. **Mathematical Analysis Error**: The analysis focused on abstract KL definition rather than the specific importance sampling estimation being used

5. **Missing Literature Review**: Didn't initially check against Schulman's k3 estimator papers or other reference implementations

This serves as a reminder to always verify mathematical intuitions with rigorous testing, especially for complex estimation procedures like importance sampling.

## Experimental Results (2025-09-11)

### Key Finding: KL Beta=0 Resolves Exploding Gradients

**Experiment**:
- Model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA (r=16, alpha=32)
- Loss type: dr_grpo
- Initial KL beta: 0.04 (default)

**Observations**:
1. **With KL beta=0.04**: 
   - `train/kl` reached **~1e5** (100,000x normal)
   - `train/grad_norm` reached **~1e5** (100,000x normal)
   - Gradients being clipped from 1e5 to 0.1 (1,000,000x reduction!)

2. **With KL beta=0.0**:
   - Gradient explosion resolved immediately
   - `train/grad_norm` returned to reasonable values
   - Training became stable

### Critical Insight: Dr. GRPO Should Use Beta=0

Research confirms that **Dr. GRPO explicitly excludes KL divergence (β=0)** when using rule-based verifiers because:
- Rule-based rewards (like MuSiQue's exact match) provide accurate signal regardless of distribution shift
- KL constraint is unnecessary and potentially harmful with deterministic verifiers
- The original Dr. GRPO paper recommends β=0 for this setup

### Remaining Issue: Rewards Still Not Improving

Despite fixing gradient explosion, rewards still fluctuate without clear improvement. This suggests:
1. The KL issue was masking another underlying problem
2. Possible LoRA weight synchronization issues in verifiers library (see new hypothesis H06)

## Experimental Priority

**Test Order**: COMPLETED (partially validated)
**Status**: 
- ✅ Confirmed that KL beta should be 0 for dr_grpo with rule-based verifiers
- ✅ Fixed gradient explosion issue
- ⚠️ Did not fully resolve training effectiveness problem

## Notes

- The verifiers library may have additional issues with LoRA training
- Need to investigate weight synchronization between policy and reference models
- Consider testing full parameter training to isolate LoRA-specific issues

---

**Next Action**: Test with `--kl-beta 0.0` after H01 validation. If H01 is confirmed, fix it first, then test KL independently.

# H03: KL Divergence Formula Verification Results

**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Hypothesis**: The KL divergence formula in GRPO/PPO might be backwards
**Result**: ❌ INVALIDATED - The formula is mathematically correct

## Summary

Through rigorous mathematical verification, we have proven that the KL divergence formula used in both the verifiers library and TRL is correct. The formula:

```python
per_token_kl = torch.exp(ref_per_token_logps - per_token_logps) - (ref_per_token_logps - per_token_logps) - 1
```

correctly computes KL(policy || reference), which is the intended direction for RLHF.

## Investigation Process

### 1. Code Review
- Examined verifiers library: `tmp/verifiers/verifiers/trainers/grpo_trainer.py:1231-1235`
- Examined TRL library: `tmp/trl/trl/trainer/grpo_trainer.py:1670-1672`
- Found both libraries use identical formulas

### 2. Mathematical Analysis

The k3 estimator is based on importance sampling theory:
- When sampling from distribution p, to estimate KL(p || q)
- The k3 estimator uses: exp(log(q/p)) - log(q/p) - 1
- This is an unbiased, low-variance estimator derived from Bregman divergence

For RLHF context:
- We sample actions from current policy π
- We want to measure KL(π || π_ref)
- Therefore: log(q/p) = log(π_ref/π) = ref_logp - policy_logp

### 3. Empirical Verification

Created two verification scripts that prove the formula is correct:

**Test 1: Direct KL Estimation** (`scripts/verify_kl_direction.py`)
- Created test distributions
- Compared k3 estimates with analytical KL values
- Result: Formula correctly estimates KL(policy || reference)

**Test 2: Importance Sampling Context** (`scripts/verify_kl_importance_sampling.py`)
- Explicitly tested importance sampling scenario
- Verified against Monte Carlo estimates
- Results:
  - GRPO formula error to KL(policy||ref): 0.012
  - Reverse formula error: 961.858 (completely wrong)

## Key Insights

1. **The formula is correct**: Both verifiers and TRL use the mathematically correct k3 estimator

2. **Common misconception**: The confusion arises from not understanding that:
   - We sample from the policy (not reference)
   - The k3 estimator accounts for this sampling distribution

3. **Why KL beta=0 helped**: While the formula is correct, using KL beta=0 for dr_grpo with rule-based verifiers is still recommended because:
   - Rule-based rewards provide accurate signal regardless of distribution shift
   - KL constraint is unnecessary with deterministic verifiers
   - Eliminates a source of gradient instability

## Implications for Debugging

Since the KL formula is correct, the training issues must stem from other causes:
- H06: LoRA weight synchronization (HIGH priority)
- H01: Advantage scaling instability (HIGH priority)
- H02: Token masking errors (HIGH priority)
- H04: Context truncation (MEDIUM priority)

## Verification Scripts

The following scripts were created for verification:
- `/scripts/verify_kl_direction.py` - Tests k3 estimator direction
- `/scripts/verify_kl_importance_sampling.py` - Tests importance sampling context

Both scripts conclusively prove the formula is mathematically correct.
